// Write a JavaScript function that iterates the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 
// three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For 
// numbers that are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

// dont need an argument because we just need to call ghd function
function fizzBuzz () {
    // loop to 100
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++)
}
